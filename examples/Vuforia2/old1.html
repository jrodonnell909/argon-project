			In 1905, after extraordinary success in barber shops and real-estate, Alonzo Herndon was approached by two prominent black church pastors. One of them, Rev. Peter Bryant of Wheat Street Baptist Church, had recently formed the Atlanta Benevolent and Protective Association, and was in dire need of capital. Herndon agreed to buy the small benevolent association for $140 and, with the acquisition and reorganization of two other companies in September of that year, formed the Atlanta Mutual Assurance Association, later to be the Atlanta Life Insurance Company.

			Through one acquistion and merger after another, Atlanta Life grew. The clients of small, failing companies, who were in jeopardy of losing their policies, were given reprieves when taken over by Atlanta Life. Confidence in the company and in Herndon's ability and judgement grew. An editor of the Atlanta Independent newspaper wrote, "When people buy a policy in Atlanta Life, they are buying Alonzo Herndon."
